In this project, making a pull request is a way to start a conversation about a piece of code. :slightly_smiling_face:

We welcome and encourage contributors to open pull requests before they are done coding to get feedback, ask questions, and to keep maintainers up-to-date on how they’re doing. Mark pull requests containing incomplete code with “WIP: ”, which stands for work-in-progress. Once the code is done, remove “WIP: ” from the title.

We use Travis CI to check that tests pass and to maintain consistent style. Before marking your pull request as done, please make sure there are no failing checks and that the branch does not conflict with the master branch. A passing branch is indicated by green checkmarks at the bottom of the pull request page; a failing branch has red X’s. If you have any questions about failing checks or merge conflicts, reach out on slack.

Pull requests with no activity from the original contributor for 30 days will be closed and the work possibly reassigned. But feel free to reopen the pull request if you come back to it later and the work has still not been completed.

If you request feedback or ask questions in your pull request, a maintainer will respond in 5 days. If we don’t, ping us on slack! From time to time, an email or message falls through the cracks. :wink:
